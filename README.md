# The Muffin Package
**The Muffin Puzzle**, first proposed by Alan Frank, is as follows.
*You have 5 muffins and 3 students. You want to divide the muffins evenly, but no student wants a tiny sliver. What division of muffins maximizes the smalles piece?*

This package goes with the book *The Mathematics of Muffins* by William Gasarch. Using the methods described by Gasarch and his team of researchs we creatd a package to find the largest possible smallist piece given any number of muffins and students.
